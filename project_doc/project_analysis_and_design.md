### Component and Deployment Diagrams
[Create the component and deployment diagrams.]

# Elaboration – Iteration 1.2

## Design Model

### Dynamic Behavior
[Create the interaction diagrams (1 sequence, 1 communication diagrams) for 2 relevant scenarios]

### Class Design
[Create the UML class diagram; apply at least 2 GoF patterns (excluding Singleton) and motivate your choice]

### Data Model
[Create the data model for the system.]

### Unit Testing
[Present the used testing methods and the associated test case scenarios.]

# Elaboration – Iteration 2

## Architectural Design Refinement
[Refine the architectural design: conceptual architecture, package design (consider package design principles), component and deployment diagrams. Motivate the changes that have been made.]

## Design Model Refinement
[Refine the UML class diagram by applying class design principles and GRASP; motivate your choices. Deliver the updated class diagrams.]

# Construction and Transition

## System Testing
[Describe how you applied integration testing and present the associated test case scenarios.]

## Future improvements
[Present future improvements for the system]
